# Introduction

Study Match is a user-friendly application available on both Android and iOS platforms, developed by Gwyn Lobaton and Jonas Rusiana of Team Iced Tea Pioneers. This app facilitates a connection between tutors and students, providing support in subjects where students need help. Its primary goal is to assist students struggling with specific subjects while enabling tutors to earn money by offering their tutoring services at their chosen hourly rates. The app matches students with tutors based on location, the tutor's expertise, special needs cases, and budget. Additionally, it includes a search option allowing users to find tutors by location or skill.
